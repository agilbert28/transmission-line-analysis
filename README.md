# transmission-line-analysis
Final Transmission Line Analysis Project for my UW Applied Electrodynamics course which implements a Transmission Line representation of a CMOS circuit using the circuit simulator program, LTSpice.

This final class project instructed students to answer many different questions in the analysis of created schematics. Integrating a myriad of transmission line techniques from the course textbook, Ulabyâ€™s Fundamentals of Applied Electronics, 7th Edition, each problem became a relevant step in solving for the overall best
Transmission Line representation circuit.
